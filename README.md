## Day 1

Day 1 was a solitary adventure, though I hope others will join in soon. Nobody really missed much -- the puzzles today were pretty straightforward and solved entirely in two lines in the interactive interpreter. Only 2,000 lines, so efficiency wasn't a big deal.

A solid start to a hopefully fun holiday season.

## Day 2

Michael joined in, but Unicornelius was a bit late to the party. Submarine adventures - solved in ~6 mins, at a rank of ~2000. Very impressed by how quickly everyone solves these things.

## Day 3

We've got a full team by now! Yasmine, Michael, Unicornelius, and Parth are all in. We fiddled around with some `numpy` magic for the first one, but ended up using it mostly for the `sum` function to count the number of 1s in a column. Part 2 was really finnicky. The edge case where the number of 1s is equal to the number of 0s prevented us from using the `min` and `max` functions. We also got confused a bit between the oxygen vs co2 rules (filter on the most or least occurring value).

It all worked out and our rank has been improving: despite 26 minutes on part 2, we got our best rank (1863) so far. Still no leaderboard, but it's possible we'll hit something soon.
